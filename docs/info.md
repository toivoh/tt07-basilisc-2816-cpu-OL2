## What it is

This is an OpenLane 2 version of `tt_um_toivoh_basilisc_2816` / https://github.com/toivoh/tt07-basilisc-2816-cpu. It omits the `mul` instruction but increases the length of the prefetch queue to 3 words. For more details, see the documentation of that project / https://github.com/toivoh/tt07-basilisc-2816-cpu/blob/main/docs/info.md.
